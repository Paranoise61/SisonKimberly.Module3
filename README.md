# Module3 ETH Proof Solidity

The creation of smart contracts on a blockchain network based on Ethereum is the single function of the Solidity programming language.

## Description

Written in Solidity, a programming language for creating smart contracts for the Ethereum blockchain, this application is a straightforward contract. A dual "Minting" and "Burning" function is included in the contract. This software acts as an easy-to-understand intro on Solidity programming and can be used as a platform for later, more complex projects.


## Getting Started

### Executing program

First we need to compile then deploy the sample address that needs to be copied and paste. Then next, mint 500, burn 127 , and then transact. After that, mint again, transact the meet, and burn. The remaining balance and the other remaining value will then appear.
